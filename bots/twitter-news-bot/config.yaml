# Twitter/X News Bot Configuration
#
# This bot monitors Twitter/X for content related to MCP, AI agents,
# and related topics, then posts updates to Zulip.
#
# Note: Since Twitter's official API is paid ($100+/month), this bot uses
# free alternatives like RSS Bridge instances or Nitter. These are less
# reliable but cost-free.

# How often to check sources (in seconds)
# Default: 3600 (1 hour)
poll_interval_seconds: 3600
