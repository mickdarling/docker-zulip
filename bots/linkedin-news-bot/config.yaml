# LinkedIn News Bot Configuration
#
# This bot monitors LinkedIn content via Google News (site:linkedin.com filter)
# for articles related to MCP, AI agents, and related topics.
#
# Note: LinkedIn doesn't have a public API for content search, so we use
# Google News RSS feeds with site filtering as a workaround.

# How often to check sources (in seconds)
# Default: 3600 (1 hour)
poll_interval_seconds: 3600
